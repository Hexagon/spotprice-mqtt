# spotprice-mqtt

Docker image which periodically scrapes spot prices from the web, and forward it to a MQTT broker.

### Features

*  Build in automation, update prices every 30 minutes
*  Sends future spot prices as separate states (+1 hour, +6 hours, +12 hours)
*  Sensds average spot price for today and tomorrow
*  Sensds average spot price for night, morning, evening and night, both today and tomorrow
*  Allows to add extra cost and apply a factor (e.g. VAT) onto spot prices
*  Handles time zone conversion automatically, just supply and receive local time
*  Supports Home Assistant MQTT auto discovery ootb
*  Sends full dataset in JSON format as an attribute to `sensor.spotprice_data`, allowing to create a forecast chart in homeassistant unsing (as an example) apexchart-card

## Installation

### Installing from Docker Hub

Install from Docker hub using the following command, make sure to change SP_MQTT_HOST/PORT/CURRENCY/AREA/TOPIC/ENTITY/DECIMALS to your own settings.

Please note that spotprice-mqtt doesn't support mqtt authentication yet.

With the default/example settings, the image will fetch spot prices every full hour, and forward it to homeassistant/sensor/spotprice_*/state, it will also send homeassistant/sensor/spotprice_*/config to make mqtt autodiscover the entities correctly.

These sensors are provided (if you use the default value for SP_ENTITY, which is "spotprice")

These environment variables can be sent to docker

| Variable name | Description                         | Example                |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|
| SP_MQTT_HOST  | IP to MQTT broker                   | 192.168.1.4            |

To get actual prices in sweden as of nov 2022 you set SP_EXTRA to about 0.095 (9.5 Ã¶re certificate fees etc), and SP_FACTOR to 1.25 (25% VAT)

Example command using homeassistant/sensors/ as base topic, which will make HA autodiscover the entities.

```
docker run \
        -d \
        --net=host \
        --restart=always \
        -e SP_MQTT_HOST=192.168.1.4 \
        -e SP_MQTT_PORT=1883 \
        -e SP_CURRENCY=SEK \
        -e SP_AREA=SE2 \
        -e SP_TOPIC=homeassistant/sensor/ \
        -e SP_ENTITY=spotprice \
        -e SP_DECIMALS=5 \
        -e SP_FACTOR=1 \
        -e SP_EXTRA=0 \
